# Known Deviations from Upstream doomgeneric

## Context

`rust-doomgeneric` is a c2rust transpile of doomgeneric, then converted phase by phase
toward idiomatic Rust (see `track16-gamestate-plan.md`, `track17-arena-indices-idea.md`).
Almost all of that work is behavior-preserving: same logic, different representation.
This document tracks the exceptions — places where a conversion phase deliberately
changed *observable runtime behavior*, not just internal structure, usually because
reproducing the original C behavior exactly would have meant fighting the type system
or threading global state through code that has no real need for it.

Each entry should say what changed, why, and what was explicitly given up, so nobody
mistakes a deviation for a bug or tries to "fix" it back to C parity without knowing
the tradeoff was intentional.

## `I_Error`: replaced with a bare Rust panic (2026-09-11)

**What changed**: `I_Error(message)` used to reimplement C's fatal-error path by hand —
print to `stderr`, run every `atexit`-registered handler flagged `run_on_error`, show a
Zenity GUI error dialog on Linux desktops (unless `-nogui`), guard against recursive
calls via an `already_quitting` flag, then `exit(-1)`. It now does exactly this:

```rust
pub unsafe fn I_Error(message: &str) -> ! {
    panic!("{}", message);
}
```

All ~110 call sites across the codebase are untouched — every one of them just calls
`I_Error(&format!(...))` or `I_Error("literal")` exactly as before.

**Why**: `I_Error` was the last of the codebase's three whole-codebase-fanout utility
hubs left over from the `GameState` bridge-collapse track (see
`track16-gamestate-plan.md`). Converting it to thread a real `&mut GameState` parameter
like its two
siblings (`S_StartSound`, `W_CacheLumpNum`/`W_CacheLumpName`) turned out to be much
more tractable than earlier tracked (82% of call sites already had `state` in scope
after those two phases), but the remaining handful required either widening more leaf
functions or accepting a real structural blocker: `G_CheckDemoStatus` is registered via
`I_AtExit` as a raw C-ABI `unsafe extern "C" fn() -> ()`, which cannot carry a `&mut
GameState` argument without breaking that callback contract. Rather than solve that,
the user asked whether `I_Error` could just become a panic instead — which sidesteps
the whole problem, since `panic!` doesn't need any state at all.

**What was given up**:
- The 3 `run_on_error`-flagged `atexit` cleanup handlers (`D_QuitNetGame` — network
  disconnect notice, `S_Shutdown` — audio device teardown, `StatDump` — crash-time
  stats dump) no longer run when `I_Error` fires. Normal quit (`I_Quit`, unrelated
  code path) still runs all registered handlers unconditionally — only the
  crash/error path lost this.
- The Zenity GUI error popup (and the `-nogui` flag that suppressed it) is gone. A
  crash now only prints Rust's standard panic message to stderr.
- The recursive-`I_Error`-call warning guard is gone (a panic inside a panic's unwind
  path aborts the process instead, which is arguably a reasonable outcome on its own).

**Removed as a result** (dead once `I_Error`'s body no longer needs them):
`ZenityErrorBox`/`EscapeShellString`/`ZenityAvailable`/`ZENITY_BINARY`,
`ISystemState::already_quitting`, `ISystemState::zenity_errorboxpath_size`, and a
handful of now-unreachable `return`/assignment statements immediately after
`I_Error(...)` calls in `g_game.rs`/`m_misc.rs`/`p_enemy.rs` (the compiler's own
`unreachable_code` lint caught these once `I_Error`'s return type became `!`).

## `player_t.message`: savegame field no longer round-trips a raw pointer (2026-09-11)

**What changed**: `player_t.message` (the pending-HUD-message slot — "Picked up a
clip.", "game saved.", cheat feedback, etc.) was `*mut c_char`, `NULL` meaning "no
message pending." Track 18 converted it to `Option<String>`. The field is also part
of the `.dsg` savegame binary format: `saveg_write_player_t`/`saveg_read_player_t`
write/read it as a raw 4-byte slot (`saveg_writep`/`saveg_readp`, the same
pointer-sized-placeholder mechanism used for several other pointer fields that get
properly relinked after load via a separate fixup pass). `message` was never one of
the fields with a real fixup pass — chocolate-doom's original C saved literally
whatever the in-process pointer bit pattern happened to be at save time, and reading
it back in a *different* process (after a load) reconstructs a bit pattern with no
relationship to any valid memory in the new process. Nothing has ever safely
dereferenced a loaded `.message` value: `P_UnArchivePlayers` (the only caller of
`saveg_read_player_t` for live players) unconditionally overwrites it to `NULL`
immediately afterward, every time. The field's 4 bytes in the file have therefore
always been meaningless padding in practice, not restorable content.

The new code preserves the file's byte *layout* exactly (still reads and writes
exactly 4 bytes for this field, so `.dsg` file size and every other field's offset is
unchanged) but writes a fixed placeholder (`0` for `None`, `1` for `Some`) instead of
a real pointer bit pattern, and unconditionally sets `message = None` on read.

**Why**: `Option<String>` cannot represent an arbitrary saved pointer value, and
there was never a real value to preserve in the first place — `P_UnArchivePlayers`
discarding it immediately confirms the original design already treated this slot as
disposable. Reconstructing "faithful" garbage would add complexity for a value that
was never observable.

**What was given up**: nothing observable. The one theoretical difference: the
original code, had some future caller ever read `.message` right after a load
without the existing unconditional reset, would have dereferenced a wild pointer
(undefined behavior, likely a crash). The new code can't do that — a loaded message
is always safely `None`. Strictly safer, not a behavior loss for any code path that
currently exists.

## `SetVariable` (m_config.rs) string duplication: intentional one-time leak (2026-09-11)

**What it does**: when a config file line sets a `DEFAULT_STRING`-typed variable
(e.g. `back_flat`, `savedir`, `video_driver`), `SetVariable` duplicates the parsed
value and stores the new pointer into the variable's bound location:
`CStr::from_ptr(value).to_owned().into_raw()`. This replaced a raw libc
`strdup(value)` call — same shape (heap-allocate a nul-terminated copy, hand back
an owned `*mut c_char`), just Rust's allocator instead of libc's.

**Why this is safe to leak**: `into_raw()` (like the `strdup` it replaced) forgets
the allocation — nothing ever calls `CString::from_raw` on these pointers to
reclaim and drop them, and nothing in the codebase calls `free()` on them either
(the only `free(` call anywhere is `w_wad.rs`'s unrelated `lumpinfo` cleanup).
Every config variable overwrite therefore leaks its previous string value for the
life of the process. This has always been true of the original C (`strdup` without
a matching `free` on reload), so it's not a new deviation — noted here so the
`into_raw()` call isn't mistaken for a bug (a "leaked memory" clippy/reviewer flag)
or "fixed" by adding a `from_raw`/drop that would double-free or free a
libc-vs-Rust-allocator-mismatched pointer.

## `EV_VerticalDoor`: dropped a byte-layout-coincidence fallback when retriggering an active mover (2026-09-12)

**What changed**: `sector_t.specialdata` was `*mut c_void`, and `EV_VerticalDoor`
(the handler for a player re-pressing/re-walking-into a door-type line while some
mover is already running on that sector) unconditionally reinterpreted it as `*mut
vldoor_t` *before* checking what it actually pointed at:

```c
door = sec->specialdata;
if (door->direction == -1) { door->direction = 1; }   // read/write through the WRONG type if door isn't really a vldoor_t
else { /* real type check via thinker->function, dispatch correctly */ }
```

The initial `door->direction == -1` check only reads the right field when the
active mover genuinely is a door. If it's actually a `plat_t`/`ceiling_t`/
`floormove_t`, this reads/writes whatever field happens to sit at the same byte
offset as `vldoor_t.direction` in that other struct's layout — a real (if
long-standing, vanilla-Doom-inherited) type-punning shortcut, and one that had
already been silently altered by an earlier track: `sector: SectorId` (a 4-byte
newtype) replaced the original `sector_t*` (an 8-byte pointer) in all four mover
structs, shifting every field after it — so this offset "coincidence" was already
producing different results than upstream well before this phase touched it.

This phase converted `specialdata` to `Option<SectorSpecial>` (a real enum:
`Door`/`Ceiling`/`Floor`/`Plat`, each holding its own typed pointer), which makes
the speculative wrong-type read impossible to express — `match`ing the enum tells
you the real type before you can touch any field. The rewrite now checks the real
type *first* in all cases, including the door-reopen check, then acts on that
type's own real field.

**Why**: the pre-check was undefined behavior in Rust regardless of layout
(reading a `*mut vldoor_t` when the pointee is actually a different type violates
Rust's aliasing rules even when the bytes happen to line up), and the "coincidence"
it depended on had already been broken by the `SectorId` shrink — so there was no
still-working behavior left to faithfully preserve, only a subtly-already-wrong one
to knowingly replace with a type-safe equivalent.

**What was given up**: the specific case of re-triggering a door-type line while an
active **Plat** is running on that sector previously reopened the "door" (in
practice, wrote into whatever plat field the coincidence landed on, likely
`plat_t.wait`) *without* requiring a player-initiated activation, before falling
through to the real Plat dispatch (`plat.wait = -1`) on the *next* retrigger. The
new code always requires a player activation and always dispatches directly to
`plat.wait = -1` for a real Plat, `ceiling.direction = -1` for a Ceiling, and
`floor.direction = -1` for a Floor (matching the pre-existing, always-type-correct
`eprintln!("...wasn't a door.")` fallback branch's intent) — same practical
end state for the common case (something ends up set to `-1`), but reached through
one consistent, type-checked path instead of two different ones depending on
whether the coincidental pre-check happened to trip first.

## Known bug (dormant): `snd_musiccmd`/`chatmacro*` config bindings can corrupt their own length field

**What's wrong**: `i_sound.rs`'s `ISoundState.snd_musiccmd` field is typed
`Option<&'static str>` (a fat pointer + length, 16 bytes on a 64-bit target), but
it's bound into the config system with `M_BindVariable(state, "snd_musiccmd",
&raw mut state.i_sound.snd_musiccmd as *mut c_void)`. `SetVariable`'s
`DEFAULT_STRING` case treats every bound string location uniformly as a bare
`*mut *mut c_char` (8 bytes) and writes only a pointer there. If a config file
ever actually contained a `snd_musiccmd` line, this would overwrite just the first
8 bytes of the 16-byte `Option<&str>`, leaving its length field as whatever
garbage was previously in memory — corrupting the value instead of setting it.

**Why it hasn't bitten anyone**: `snd_musiccmd` is written to `default.cfg` (as
part of the full config dump) but never read back anywhere else in the port — the
sound backend this was wired up for was dropped along the way and nothing
dereferences `state.i_sound.snd_musiccmd`. The corruption happens but nothing
looks at the corrupted value, so it's inert today.

**A second instance, found during the `default_t.location` → `DefaultLocation`
enum conversion (2026-09-12)**: `hu_stuff.rs`'s `chat_macros: [&'static str; 10]`
has the identical shape of problem — each of the 10 `chatmacro0`..`chatmacro9`
bindings passes `&raw mut chat_macros[i]` (a 16-byte `&'static str` slot) into a
system that, for `DEFAULT_STRING` variables, only ever writes an 8-byte `*mut
c_char`. This conversion phase fixed the *addressing* half of the bug — the
pre-existing code computed each binding's address by casting the whole array to
`*mut *mut c_char` and using `.offset(i)`, which steps 8 bytes at a time over an
array whose real element stride is 16 bytes, so `chatmacro1`'s bound address
actually pointed into the *second half of `chat_macros[0]`* (its length field),
`chatmacro2` into `chat_macros[1]`'s first half, and so on — a config file setting
any `chatmacro` line beyond `chatmacro0` would have corrupted a *different*
slot's data than the one named. It's now `&raw mut chat_macros[i]`, so each
binding at least addresses its own slot. The underlying storage-type mismatch
(an 8-byte write landing in a 16-byte fat-pointer slot) described above for
`snd_musiccmd` still applies here unchanged — writing a `chatmacro` line from a
config file would still corrupt that one slot's length field, just no longer a
neighboring slot's. Same "why it hasn't bitten anyone" reasoning applies: nothing
in this codebase's `M_SaveDefaults` actually writes a config file (it's a no-op
stub), so the only way this fires is a hand-edited or copied-from-another-port
config file containing a `chatmacro1..9` line.

**Why neither is fully fixed here**: found incidentally while replacing `strdup`
in `SetVariable` (`snd_musiccmd`, same 8-byte pointer write existed before that
change) and while giving `default_t.location` a real type (`chatmacro*`, same
underlying mismatch, pre-existing under the old `*mut c_void` representation
too — neither is a regression from either conversion). Fixing either properly
means either giving the field a `*mut c_char`-shaped storage representation
consistent with every other `DEFAULT_STRING` binding, or teaching `SetVariable`/
`DefaultLocation` about wide (`&str`-shaped) string locations specifically — both
are a real design decision, not a drive-by fix, so it's flagged here instead of
silently patched. **Before ever wiring a reader up to `snd_musiccmd`, or writing
a `chatmacro` config line, or converting another `DEFAULT_STRING`-bound field to
`&'static str`/`Option<&'static str>`**, fix this binding mechanism first.
